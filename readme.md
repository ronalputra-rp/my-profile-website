# 🌟 My Personal Developer Portfolio

## 📝 Project Description

This personal portfolio website serves as a central hub to showcase my skills and the various development projects I have worked on.

The main goal is to deliver a professional, responsive, and intuitive user experience to potential employers and collaborators.

## 🛠️ Current Status & Technologies

The project is currently focused on the **Front-End Structure and Styling** phase, dedicated to establishing a robust and aesthetically pleasing interface before full interactivity is implemented.

| Component | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | ✅ Complete | Semantic content structure and accessibility foundations are in place. |
| **CSS3** | ✅ Complete | Core styling, layout definition (using modular CSS principles), and **mobile responsiveness** have been finalized. |
| **JavaScript (JS)** | ⏳ Planning Stage | Full interactive functionality (such as form validation, filters, and dynamic content) is planned for the next iteration. |

### Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
